# XtoCHD

A powerful GUI application to convert disk images to CHD format using chdman with advanced features and comprehensive statistics.

## What is XtoCHD?

XtoCHD helps you convert various disk image formats (like .cue, .bin, .iso, .img, .zip) to .CHD format. This is useful for retro gaming and emulation. The application provides a user-friendly interface with advanced features for batch processing and detailed conversion reporting.

## Download

### For End Users (No Installation Required)
1. Download the latest release ZIP file from the [Releases](https://github.com/Xplizet/XtoCHD/releases) page
2. Extract the ZIP file to any folder
3. Double-click `XtoCHD.exe` to run (chdman.exe is included in the release)

### For Developers
1. Clone this repository
2. Install Python 3.7+
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run: `python main.py`

## Windows Defender False Positive

**⚠️ Important**: Some antivirus software, including Windows Defender, may flag XtoCHD as a potential threat. This is a **false positive**.

### Why This Happens
- **Heuristic Detection**: Antivirus software uses machine learning to detect patterns that might indicate threats
- **File Operations**: XtoCHD performs many file operations (reading, writing, extracting ZIPs) which can trigger security heuristics
- **Subprocess Calls**: The app calls external programs (`chdman.exe`) which can look suspicious to antivirus software
- **Python Packaging**: Compiled Python applications often trigger false positives

### This is NOT a Virus
XtoCHD is **completely safe**:
- ✅ **Open Source**: Code is publicly available on GitHub
- ✅ **No Network Activity**: App doesn't connect to the internet
- ✅ **Local Only**: All operations performed on your local files
- ✅ **No Data Collection**: App doesn't send any data anywhere
- ✅ **File Operations Only**: Only reads/writes files you specify

### How to Handle This

#### Option 1: Add Exception (Recommended)
1. Open Windows Security
2. Go to "Virus & threat protection"
3. Click "Manage settings" under "Virus & threat protection settings"
4. Scroll down to "Exclusions"
5. Add the XtoCHD folder as an exclusion

#### Option 2: Run from Source
If you're concerned, run the Python source directly:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Why This is Common
Many legitimate software tools get false positives:
- **7-Zip** (file compression)
- **AutoHotkey** (automation)
- **Python applications** (especially when packaged)
- **Game modding tools**
- **File conversion utilities**

The application is completely safe to use. This is a known issue with antivirus software and Python applications.

## How to Use

1. **Select Input**: Choose a file or folder containing disk images, or drag and drop files/folders directly onto the application
2. **Select Output**: Pick where to save the converted .CHD files (auto-suggests `[input]/CHD/`)
3. **Set chdman Path**: The app will auto-detect `chdman.exe` if it's in the same folder, or you can manually browse to it
4. **Configure Validation**: Use the "Fast Validation Mode" toggle to choose between fast (5-10x faster) or thorough validation
5. **Scan Files**: Files are automatically scanned when you select input (scanning runs in background for better responsiveness)
6. **Review Validation**: Check file validation status with visual indicators (✓ for valid, ✗ for invalid)
7. **Select Files**: Check/uncheck which files to convert (file sizes are displayed for reference)
8. **Start Conversion**: Click "Start Conversion" and monitor progress
9. **Stop if Needed**: Use the "Stop Conversion" button to cancel at any time
10. **Review Results**: Check the comprehensive conversion summary at the end
11. **View Output**: Use the "Open Output Folder" button to quickly access your converted files

## Temp File Management

XtoCHD includes a comprehensive temp file management system to ensure clean operation:

### Automatic Cleanup
- **Dedicated Temp Directory**: All temp files stored in `[XtoCHD_directory]/temp/`
- **Crash-Proof Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup even if the application crashes
- **Startup Cleanup**: Removes orphaned temp files on application startup
- **Per-File Cleanup**: Temp files cleaned up after each individual conversion

### Manual Management
- **Tools Menu**: Access "Temp Directory Info" and "Clean Temp Directory" options
- **Size Monitoring**: Automatic warnings for large temp directories (>100MB)
- **Status Logging**: Clear logging of temp directory operations and cleanup

### Crash Handling
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Temp files are automatically cleaned up on next startup
- **Age-Based Cleanup**: Removes temp directories older than 1 hour
- **Process Tracking**: Unique temp directory names prevent conflicts

## Supported Formats

- **Input**: .cue, .bin, .iso, .img, .nrg, .gdi, .toc, .ccd, .vcd, .chd, .zip, .cdr, .hdi, .vhd, .vmdk, .dsk
- **Output**: .CHD
